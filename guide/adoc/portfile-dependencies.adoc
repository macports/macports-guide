= Dependencies

Free and open source software is highly modular, and MacPorts ports often require that other ports be installed beforehand; these prerequisites for a given port are called a port's "`dependencies`".

The keywords used when specifying dependencies in a Portfile are related to port install phases, and they refer to what are called library, build, fetch, extract and run dependencies.
Though all of them install dependencies before a given port is installed, specifying dependencies with the correct keyword is important for proper port upgrade and uninstall behavior, or when running targets other than install.
For example, you may not uninstall a port that is a library dependency for another installed port, though you may remove one that is a build dependency.
Likewise, if you run the fetch target for a port, only the fetch dependencies will be installed first, so they should be all that is needed for that target.

depends_fetch::
The list of dependencies to check before phases ``fetch``, ``checksum``, ``extract``, ``patch``, ``configure``, ``build``, ``destroot``, ``install``, and ``package``.
Fetch dependencies are needed to download the distfiles for a port, and are not needed at all once the software is installed.

depends_extract::
The list of dependencies to check before phases ``extract``, ``patch``, ``configure``, ``build``, ``destroot``, ``install``, and ``package``.
Extract dependencies are needed to unpack a port's distfiles into the work directory, and are not needed at all once the software is installed.

depends_build::
The list of dependencies to check before phases ``configure``, ``build``, ``destroot``, ``install``, and ``package``.
Build dependencies are needed when software is being built, but not needed at all once it is installed.

depends_lib::
The list of dependencies to check before phases ``configure``, ``build``, ``destroot``, ``install``, and ``package``.
Library dependencies are needed both at build time (for headers and libraries to link against) and at run time.

depends_test::
The list of dependencies to check before phase ``test``.
Test dependencies are only needed when the port enables testing (i.e. ``test.run            yes``). 

depends_run::
The list of dependencies to check before phases ``destroot``, ``install``, and ``package``.
Run dependencies are needed when the software is run, but not to compile it.

== Port and File Dependencies

There are two types of dependencies: port dependencies and file dependencies.
Port dependencies can be satisfied by reference to a port (the MacPorts registry is queried), or by reference to a file (whether provided by a port or not). The most commonly-used type of dependencies in Portfiles are port dependencies, because dependencies should be provided by MacPorts ported software whenever possible, and usually only one port can provide the needed libraries and files.

But when satisfying a dependency with vendor-supplied software is preferred for special reasons, or when it is possible for more than one port to satisfy a dependency, then file dependencies may be used.
An example of the former is with ubiquitous utilities like awk, grep, make or sed, where the versions in macOS are often sufficient; an example of the latter is with "`-devel`" ports--these ports provide a different version of the same files (though only one can be activated at a time).

Port dependencies, the preferred type, are specified as shown in these examples:

[source]
----
depends_lib         port:rrdtool port:apache2

depends_build       port:libtool

depends_run         port:apache2 port:php5
----

File dependencies should only be used if one of the reasons listed above applies.
There are three types: `bin` for programs, `lib` for libraries, and `path` for any installed file.
File dependencies are specified in the form: ``<type>``:``<filespec>``:``<port>``.

For `bin` dependencies, `<filespec>` is the name of a program in a bin directory like [path]`${prefix}/bin`, /usr/bin, /bin, and the associated sbin directories.

For `lib` dependencies, `<filespec>` is the name of a library (but without its extension) in a lib directory like [path]`${prefix}/lib`, /usr/lib, /lib, some Framework directories, and those found in environment variables like DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH.

For `path` dependencies, `<filespec>` is the complete absolute path to the file, or more usually, when the file is inside [path]`${prefix}`, it is specified relative to [path]`${prefix}`.
Since `path` dependencies are the only ones which would find files only in an absolute path or a path inside [path]`${prefix}` they are - in cases when a port needs to be more restrictive - often used instead of `bin` and `lib` dependencies .

Note that the `<port>` specified is only installed if the specified library, binary, or file is not found.
