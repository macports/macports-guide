= Tcl Extensions & Useful Tcl Commands

A MacPorts Portfile is a Tcl script, so it may contain any arbitrary Tcl code you may learn about in the https://www.tcl.tk/doc/[Tcl documentation].
However, few authors will use arbitrary Tcl code; the vast majority will use a subset of Tcl commands and a number of Tcl extensions that are coded within MacPorts for performing the most common tasks needed for Portfiles.
The list below is a list of useful Tcl commands for Portfile development and Tcl extensions provided by MacPorts base.

file::
The standard Tcl [cmd]``+file+`` command can be used for a number of operations on files, such as moving, renaming, deleting, or creating directories, among others.
For a complete list, consult the https://www.tcl.tk/man/tcl/TclCmd/file.htm[Tcl
reference manual for the file command], or the Tcl file manpage in the `+n+` section of manpages on your machine using [cmd]``+man n file+``

file copy::
Copy a file.

file rename::
Rename a file.

file delete [-force]::
Remove a file or (with ``+-force+``) a directory and its contents.

file mkdir::
Create a directory.
macros::
For the above operations provided by Tcl's [cmd]``+file+`` command, MacPorts provides the following shorthands.
These should be used in preference to the Tcl commands above, as they may work around certain bugs.

copy::
Shorthand for ``+file copy+``.

move::
Similar to `+file rename+` but correctly handles renames that only change the case of a file on a case-insensitive filesystem.

delete::
Shorthand for ``+file delete -force+``.

touch::
Mimics the BSD touch command.

ln::
Mimics the BSD ln command.
xinstall::
xinstall copies files and creates directories; it is intended to be compatible with install(1).

xinstall [-o ``+owner+``] [-g ``+group+``] [-m ``+mode+``] [``+file1 file2 ...+``] `+directory+`::
Install the specified file(s) to a destination directory.

xinstall [-o ``+owner+``] [-g ``+group+``] [-m ``+mode+``] [-W ``+dir+``] [``+file1 file2 ...+``] `+directory+`::
Change to `+dir+` and install file(s) to a destination directory.

xinstall [-o ``+owner+``] [-g ``+group+``] [-m ``+mode+``] {*}[glob ``+pattern+``] `+directory+`::
Install the file(s) matching the glob pattern to a destination directory.
Note the use of the `+{*}+` operator to convert the list returned by [cmd]``+glob+`` into separate arguments to [cmd]``+xinstall+``.

xinstall -d [-o ``+owner+``] [-g ``+group+``] [-m ``+mode+``] `+directory+`::
Create a directory including parent directories if necessary.
+
Defaults:

* owner -
* group -
* mode - `+0755+`

+
Examples:
+

xinstall -m 640 ${worksrcpath}/README \
   ${destroot}${prefix}/share/doc/${name}

strsed::
strsed can be used for string manipulations using regular expressions.
It supports a small subset of the commands known from sed(1).

strsed `+string+` s/``+regex+``/``+replacement+``/ ::
Replaces the first instance of `+regex+` with ``+replacement+``.
Refer to re_format(7) for a definition of regular expression syntax.

strsed `+string+` g/``+regex+``/``+replacement+``/ ::
The same as the previous format, except all instances of the pattern will be replaced, not only the first (mnemonic: 'g' is for global).
reinplace::
Allows text specified by a regular expression to be replaced by new text, in-place (the file will be updated itself, no need to place output into a new file and rename).
 reinplace [-locale ``+locale+``] [-n] [-W ``+dir+``] [--] `+command+```+file [``+file2 ...+``]::
Replace text given by the regular expression portion of the command with the replacement text, in all files specified.
+
Use -locale to set the locale.
The default locale is ``+en_US.UTF-8+``.
For example, `+-locale C+` will allow a non-UTF-8 file to be modified (which may otherwise give the error "sed: RE error: illegal byte sequence"), but only operating on ASCII characters.
If you need it to work on non-ASCII characters you need to set a locale with the correct charset for the file, e.g.
"en_US.ISO8859-1".
+
-n is passed to sed to suppress echoing result
+
-W to set a common working directory for multiple files
+
Use -E to use the extended regular expression style (see re_format(7) for a description of the basic and extended styles)
+
Use -- to end option processing and allow any further dashes not to be treated as options.
+
Examples:
+

----
reinplace -W ${worksrcpath} "s|/usr/local|${prefix}|g" configure setup.py

reinplace "s|@@PREFIX@@|${prefix}|g" ${worksrcpath}/Makefile

user/group::


adduser username [uxml:id=``+uid+``] [gxml:id=``+gid+``] [passwd=``+passwd+``] [realname=``+realname+``] [home=``+home+``] [shell=``+shell+``]::
Add a new local user to the system with the specified uid, gid, password, real name, home directory and login shell.

existsuser `+username+`::
Check if a local user exists.
Returns the uid for the given user, or 0 if the user wasn't found.
Checking for the root user is not supported because its uid is 0, and it will always exist anyway.

nextuid::
Returns the highest used uid plus one.

addgroup `+group+` [gxml:id=``+gid+``] [passwd=``+passwd+``] [realname=``+realname+``] [users=``+users+``]::
Add a new local group to the system, with the specified gid, password, real name, and with a list of users as members.

existsgroup `+group+`::
Check if a local group exists and return the corresponding gid.
This can be used with adduser:
+


[source]
----
addgroup foo
adduser foo gxml:id=[existsgroup foo]
----

nextgid::
Returns the highest used gid plus one.
External program execution::
Use only when ....
