    <title>Using Trac for Tickets</title>

    <para>The MacPorts Project uses a system called <link
    xlink:href="https://trac.macports.org/">Trac</link> to file tickets to report bugs
    and enhancement requests. Though anyone may search Trac for tickets,
    you must have a <link
    xlink:href="https://github.com/join">GitHub account</link> in order to login to
    <link xlink:href="https://trac.macports.org/">Trac</link> to create tickets.</para>

            If a build fails or is otherwise interrupted, and you try again,
            MacPorts tries to pick up where it left off. Sometimes this causes
            new problems, and even if it doesn't, it means that log messages
            from earlier steps, which can be essential for figuring out why a
            build failed, are not included in the new log; MacPorts prints
            <quote>Skipping completed</quote> in the log for each
            previously-completed phase that was skipped. Before filing a
            ticket, <userinput>sudo port clean</userinput> the port that
            failed, then try again.</para>

          <para>
            In general, application bugs should be reported to the developers of the app
            (<quote>upstream</quote>), not MacPorts. An application bug that affects a large number of
            MacPorts users might merit a MacPorts bug for informational purposes only, but
            this should be done sparingly.

          <para>Is the problem with a 'port upgrade' operation?</para>
          <para>
            If so, try a 'port uninstall <replaceable>foo</replaceable>' and
            then reinstall. You might also want to run 'port -nR upgrade --force
            <replaceable>foo</replaceable>' to rebuild ports depending upon
            port <replaceable>foo</replaceable>.
            Note that it is safest and recommended that most users always upgrade
            with 'port upgrade outdated' to update all ports at once. Upgrading a
            single port can lead to software errors in other ports that have not
            yet been upgraded.

        To become the maintainer of a port, first check whether the port
        already has a maintainer. Run

        <programlisting><prompt>%%</prompt> <userinput>port info --maintainer $portname</userinput></programlisting>

        where <userinput>$portname</userinput> is the name of the port you want
        to maintain. If the output is

        <screen>maintainer: </screen>

        the port is unmaintained and you are more than welcome to take it over.
        If the output lists a different email address, you can still
        co-maintain the port, but you should contact the existing maintainer(s)
        first.
      </para>

      <para>
        Once you have verified that a port is unmaintained or the existing
        maintainer has invited you to co-maintain the port of your choice,
        follow these steps to become a maintainer:
      </para>

      <orderedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>Locate the port's directory and make a copy. MacPorts can help
            you locate the directory that contains the
            <filename>Portfile</filename> by running <userinput>port dir
              $portname</userinput>. Copy this directory to a separate location
            (so you can easily generate a patch later) that is readable by the
            macports user. In general, your home directory does not fulfill
            that requirement, but <filename>/var/tmp</filename> does.

            <programlisting><prompt>%%</prompt> <userinput>cp -r $(port dir $portname) /var/tmp</userinput></programlisting>

            Check <filename>/var/tmp</filename> for the new directory. In most
            cases, its name should be equal to the name of the port you want to
            maintain. In those few cases where it is not (i.e., the so-called
            <option>subports</option> feature is used), check the output of
            <userinput>port dir $portname</userinput> for the correct name.
          </para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>Change to the new directory and run <userinput>port
              info</userinput> to make sure everything went right. Note that
            running any port command without a port name tries to use the
            <filename>Portfile</filename> in the current directory. This is
            very helpful when testing modifications or new ports, so keep this
            in mind.
          </para>

          <programlisting><prompt>%%</prompt> <userinput>cd /var/tmp/$portname</userinput>
<!--      --><prompt>%%</prompt> <userinput>port info</userinput><!--
          --></programlisting>

          <para>If you don't see info output for the port, but an error message
            instead, it will usually be in the following form:</para>

          <screen>Can't map the URL 'file://.' to a port description file ("couldn't read file "Portfile": permission denied").
Please verify that the directory and portfile syntax are correct.
To use the current port, you must be in a port's directory.</screen>

          <para>Pay attention to the part in the brackets in the first line. It
            will either contain a permission problem (in which case you need to
            adjust the permissions of your <filename>Portfile</filename> and
            the folders leading up to it), or a Tcl error message, in case of
            syntax errors in the <filename>Portfile</filename>. Also check that
            the copy of the working directory is in fact the current working
            directory in your shell.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>Open the <filename>Portfile</filename> in your favorite editor
            and look for the line that starts with <option>maintainer</option>.
            Delete <option>nomaintainer</option> from the line if it exists and
            add your own GitHub username or email address. For GitHub
            usernames, prefix your username with an <literal>@</literal> sign.
            Email addresses should be written in the form
            <userinput>domain.tld:localpart</userinput>. The address is
            obfuscated to prevent email harvesters from automatically grabbing
            your address. If you want, you can start fixing bugs in the
            <filename>Portfile</filename> as well.</para>

          <para>At this point, please read <xref
              linkend="project.update-policies.nonmaintainer" /> and
            familiarize yourself with the meaning of
            <option>openmaintainer</option>. Consider adding
            <option>openmaintainer</option> to speed up and simplify small
            updates of your port. If you decided to allow minor updates without
            consultation, add <userinput>openmaintainer</userinput>, separated
            with a space, to the <option>maintainer</option> line of the
            <filename>Portfile</filename>.</para>

          <para>Once you are done, save the file and verify the
            <filename>Portfile</filename> structure using MacPorts' builtin
            lint check:</para>

          <programlisting><prompt>%%</prompt> <userinput>port lint --nitpick</userinput></programlisting>

          <para>You will likely see at least one error:</para>

          <screen>Error: Portfile parent directory tmp does not match primary category $XYZ</screen>

          <para>You can safely ignore <emphasis>this</emphasis> message. It is
            printed because the copy of the port's directory is not in
            a directory named after the port's primary category, but in
            <filename>/var/tmp</filename> instead. Please try to address all
            other warnings and error messages, though. If you need help, feel
            free to continue and add a note to the ticket you will
            create asking for instructions.</para>

          <para>Finally, run <userinput>port info</userinput> again. The
            maintainers line in the output should now contain your email
            address or GitHub username.</para>

          <note>
            <para>If you made changes other than the maintainer line, you might
              want to test build and installation as well. To do that, run

    <title>Port Update Policies</title>

    <para>Port maintainers normally are given commit privileges to the
    Subversion repository so they can make updates to their own ports as
    described in <xref linkend="project.membership" />.
    However, The MacPorts Project does not restrict commit privileges for
    maintainers, so before a person other than a port's maintainer updates a
    port it is a good practice to inform a port's maintainer. See details
    below.</para>

    <section id="project.update-policies.nonmaintainer">
      <title>Non-Maintainer Port Updates</title>

      <para>If you have a port update or bugfix for a port you do not
      maintain, to respect the rights of the port maintainer you should follow
      the following guidelines:</para>

      <orderedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>If a port's maintainer is
          <email>nomaintainer@macports.org</email>, you may feel free to make
          updates and/or take maintainership of the port.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>If a port's maintainer contains the address
          <email>openmaintainer@macports.org</email>, this means that the
          author allows minor updates to the port without contacting him
          first. But permission should still be sought for major
          changes.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>Create patch file(s) as necessary, attach them to a Trac
          ticket, and assign the ticket to the maintainer (or Cc him or

        </listitem>
      </orderedlist>

      <para>However, for maintained ports without
      <email>openmaintainer@macports.org</email>, there are some conditions
      under which maintainer permission may be waived:</para>

        <listitem>
          <para>If the maintainer does not respond within 72 hours, you or
          another committer may review the patches and update the port. The log
          message of this commit must explain that you are taking advantage of
          maintainer timeout and include a reference to the ticket. If you are
          not a committer you may send an email to
          <email>macports-dev@lists.macports.org</email> and request the
          updates be committed.</para>
