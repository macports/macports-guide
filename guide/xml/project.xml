    <title>Using Trac for tickets</title>

    <para>The MacPorts Project uses a system called <ulink
    url="http://trac.edgewall.org/">Trac</ulink> to file tickets to report bugs
    and enhancement requests. Trac also provides an interface to browse the
    <ulink url="https://trac.macports.org/browser/">MacPorts
    Subversion repository</ulink>. Though anyone may search Trac for tickets,
    you must <ulink
    url="https://trac.macports.org/auth/register/">register</ulink> for a Trac
    account to create tickets.</para>

          <para>
            If a build fails or is otherwise interrupted, and you try again,
            MacPorts tries to pick up where it left off. Sometimes this causes
            new problems, and even if it doesn't, it means that log messages
            from earlier steps, which can be essential for figuring out why a
            build failed, are not included in the new log; MacPorts prints
            <quote>Skipping completed</quote> in the log for each
            previously-completed phase that was skipped. Before filing a
            ticket, <userinput>sudo port clean</userinput> the port that
            failed, then try again.

            In general, application bugs should be reported to the developers of the app

            MacPorts users might merit a MacPorts bug for informational purposes only, but
            this should be done sparingly.

          formatting</ulink> should be used to ensure that text is formatted

          <para>Submitters are advised to trim inline pastes and logs to

    <title>Port Update Policies</title>

    <para>Port maintainers normally are given commit privileges to the
    Subversion repository so they can make updates to their own ports.
    However, The MacPorts Project does not restrict commit privileges for
    maintainers, so before a person other than a port's maintainer updates a
    port it is a good practice to inform a port's maintainer. See details
    below.</para>

    <section id="project.update-policies.nonmaintainer">
      <title>Non-Maintainer Port Updates</title>

      <para>If you have a port update or bugfix for a port you do not

      the following guidelines:</para>

      <orderedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>If a port's maintainer is

        <listitem>
          <para>If a port's maintainer contains the address
          <email>openmaintainer@macports.org</email>, this means that the
          author allows minor updates to the port without contacting him

          changes.</para>

        <listitem>
          <para>Create patch file(s) as necessary, attach them to a Trac

      </orderedlist>

          maintainer timeout and include a reference to the ticket. If you are
