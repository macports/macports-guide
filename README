This is the MacPorts documentation directory.

To generate it you have to checkout the entire "macports-guide" repository,
and you need the "docbook-xsl", "docbook-xml-4.5" and "libxslt" ports.
If your port installation isn't in /opt/local, edit or override the
PREFIX Makefile variable.

To generate the guide just run "make" in this directory; the HTML version will
be placed in guide/html.

To generate a PDF version of the guide, use "make guide-dblatex". This
requires the "dblatex" port.
